Develop a use case diagram, including all the imagined steps in a new process. It could mean using the “As-Is” and “To-Be” model, where you diagram the current steps required (As-Is) and then add a “swim lane” (To-Be) showing the optimised solution.

It’s worth spending the time documenting the ‘As-Is’ for major or complex processes so the entire team can develop a common understanding of the business process.

The ‘To-Be’ model shows how the business process becomes adjusted with the new system in place (sometimes it’s helpful to overlay the As-Is with the To-Be to understand the changes).

Put yourself in the role of the user and think about how they go from one step to another to achieve their goals using the software and what dependencies might be involved (such as querying the database for a unique identifier). Note that it’s also important to know what users should not be doing with the software, or abilities that should be invisible to them!

Another useful tool is to collect user stories on how they do things. If a user story is too complicated, it can be broken down into smaller stories and supported with diagrams.

Often scoping the project might require a context diagram to define the system’s boundary, its surrounding environment and all the interacting entities.

Being complete also means being thorough: know the system and how it works in the context necessary. How will it integrate with other systems? How will the databases communicate? What APIs will be needed and how are they already being used? By constructing a visual model of the software solution, you’ll get a better idea of the major interactions and players in your system.

A different sort of diagram that can be used is the top-down illustration, called a functional decomposition diagram, which is useful to break down the system into major chunks.

Remember not to make assumptions or take anything for granted. Be as detailed as possible and document every step needed to accomplish a task. Reiterate the key objectives during the requirements gathering process to ensure everyone is happy. One way to do this is to use SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Agreed-upon, Realistic and Time-based.

Ask your stakeholders what they need and how your team can make their lives easier. Have they encountered pitfalls on other projects and can it be worked into the current spec as potential hazards? This is part diplomacy and part functional requirement gathering.

Finally, if you hit problems, then it’s better to have encountered them early on, during the requirements gathering stage, rather than at some time further down the road, when it could cost additional time and money to put right!
